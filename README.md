# Encryption software

[Releases](https://github.com/JLMJLMJLM14159/Encryption-software/releases)

Just a simple encryption software. You need a key file to open the encrypted file, and that key file will be as big as the file you encrypt. Then you simply need to get both the key and the encrypted file and decrypt them.

## Benefits
- The encrypted file could essentially be any file of that length, and you could create another key that could turn it into any other file of that length. This means that without the key, the only thing you know (and will ever know) is the file size, which doesn't really tell you that much.
- idk i mean it encrypts (and decrypts) stuff what more do u want

## Weaknesses
- THERE IS NO RECOVERY - if you encrypt a file and lose the key, say goodbye to whatever was in that file.
- It might take a while if you have a MASSIVE file but it's worth it right ??
